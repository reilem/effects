## Setup

All code in this repo will require ocaml and opam to setup, compile and run.

Ocaml compiler and library installation instructions can be found at:
https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html
Opam is the main Ocaml package manager. Installation instructions can be found at:
http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

## Running code

It is recommended to download and use ledit to run our code interactively.
Ocaml and Eff provide a standard top level interpreter put ledit provides some much needed functionality.

Ledit can be setup with `opam install ledit`, and then used with either
`ledit ocaml` or `ledit eff`.
